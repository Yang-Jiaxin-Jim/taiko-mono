# Types of provers

## Community prover

Currently, you only need a single proof from the any prover to verify a block. 

## Oracle prover

The oracle prover is a prover from a unique address (our own address) that is able to override the community prover. This is a safety mechanism we have in place while the ZK-EVM is still in development and in case an invalid block was marked as verified from a community proof.

## System proof

A system proof is a fake proof that is generated by the system to mark a block as verified. We only require a real proof to be generated every N blocks. Otherwise, we accept a fake, system proof, and mark the block as verified. This is a temporary testnet feature to reduce the cost for community provers.

## The proof cooldown period

We have a proof cooldown period which is an interval of time we set after fully verifying a block. The reason we do that is to allow for a fault proof to come in, once we have a multi-prover system set in place.
